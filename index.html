          <h2>TOUGHEST MAN ON THE PLANET</h2>
          <p>
            <b>David Goggins</b> is a rare breed of human being. His commitment to the philosophy of 'achieving your greatness by giving life all you got' through mental toughness and self discipline has been an anchor of inspiration and motivation to millions around the world - myself included. To me, what makes David rare isn't his elite U.S. Navy SEAL career or his record-breaking endurance events as an athlete. What makes him rare is, from the day we connected, he's always been a real guy who shoots from the hip and speaks from the heart. And that's what matters most. Hardest workers in the room.
